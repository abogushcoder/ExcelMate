# ExcelMate

This Python script automates the process of reading text files with fixed-width columns, formatting the data, and exporting it to an Excel file. It is particularly useful for processing text data that requires manual delimitation and formatting, saving significant time and effort.

## Features

- **Data Formatting**: Supports formatting columns as currency, dates, times, or general values in Excel.
- **Excel Export**: Automates the creation of formatted Excel files using the OpenPyXL library.
- **Reusability**: Saves user-defined configurations as JSON files for easy reuse in subsequent sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for file input/output operations.
